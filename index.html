       waits for the elements inside the bode to load.  Therefore
       we don't run the most important parts of the code until the page has finished loading.

# This Map will eventually Become some kind of tour of Toronto.

Your first task will be to locate some real places.  You can get the precise locations at various services, e.g [latlong.net](http://www.latlong.net/).

Then add those places to the marker array in [script.js](./script.js) (see instructions there).

replace this text and the text with your essay. But be sure not to eliminate the html elements that
are contained inside this textarea, or [your map won't work at all!][1] [1](#one)

It makes sense to put an introductory paragraph here, above the map and buttons. To change the bootswatch thenme, change "united" to one of the other theme names listed at [strapdownjs.com](http://strapdownjs.com/).

The rest of your essay should go under the map, probably.

## in sections like this
also _italics_ and __bold__ which can also be written *like this* or **like this**
etc. Be sure to [make use of links](http://digital.hackinghistory.ca) -- that's one of the reasons we write on the Web, and I've asked you to use links for all yor footnotes/references as well.
